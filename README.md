## 🏛️ Comprehensive Architectural Enhancements (Final v8 Audit)

Below is the definitive ledger of the 24 foundational enhancements and defect remediations implemented in this release:

### 1. Executive Portal Oversight & Role Switching
* **Admin Portal Switching:** The Super Admin dashboard includes an elegant interactive tab bar allowing administrators to instantly switch between the **Main Admin Command Centre**, **Staff/Teacher Portal**, **Parent Portal**, and **Student Portal** without creating separate user accounts.
* **Granular Privilege Mapping:** Non-admin roles (students, parents, teachers) see clean, read-only tables for institutional announcements, school timetables, and calendars. Action columns and "+ Add new" buttons are dynamically scoped to avoid layout shifts.

### 2. Bulletproof Row-Level Security (RLS) & Isolation
* **Academic Periods & Lookups:** Updated helper functions (`is_admin` and `is_staff`) and RLS policies to recognize `status in ('approved', 'active')`, permanently eliminating `"new row violates row-level security policy for table 'academic_periods'"`.
* **Subject Teacher Isolation:** Enforced strict record isolation across `results`, `attendance`, `scheme_of_work`, `lesson_plans`, and `assignments`. Subject teachers can only edit or delete records they personally authored; other teachers' records are locked, while administrators maintain universal override capabilities.

### 3. Advanced Academic, CBT, & Assessment Engines
* **Downloadable AI Prompt Templates (`cbt-prompts.html`):** Fully aligned with HMG Academy CBT Pro standards. Features ready-to-copy structured prompts (Simple, Intermediate, Advanced) instructing external AI models to generate downloadable CSV question banks covering all 17 question types.
* **Complete CBT Examination Repair (`cbt-exam.html`):** Resolved the `?code=` query loading defect by syncing the student runtime to inspect both `data.questions` and `data._questions`. Students can take shared exam codes instantly without user accounts.
* **Unified Scoresheet, Broadsheet, & Report Cards (`report-cards.html`):** Consolidated academic reporting into three distinct outputs: **Subject Scoresheets** (editable solely by the subject teacher), **Class Broadsheets** (collating all subject marks for an entire class), and **Student Report Cards**. All parameter inputs use dynamic `<select>` dropdowns.

### 4. Enterprise Administrative & Communication Suite
* **Dedicated Parent Registry (`parents.html`):** Introduced a standalone `parents` database table and full CRUD management interface (recording name, email, phone, occupation, address, status) alongside a robust parent-child linking engine.
* **Two-Way In-App Messaging (`messages.html` & `inbox.html`):** Established seamless two-way communication between students/parents and teachers/staff/admins. All in-app messages route to `module_records` (`module: 'inbox'`).
* **E-Receipt Printing (`fees.html` & `student-profile.html`):** Embedded "Print E-Receipt" functionality across parent fee tables and student 360° dashboards, featuring dynamic school logos and official bursar/principal signatures.
* **Google Drive Media & Signature Rendering (`gallery.html` & `settings.html`):** Refactored Google Drive URL parsing to utilize direct viewing exports (`/uc?export=view&id=`), ensuring high-fidelity rendering of official signatures, student ID photos, and gallery thumbnails without 403 authorization blocks.
* **Executive Analytics (`analytics.html`):** Expanded platform analytics to feature 6 advanced Chart.js visualizations: CBT Score Distribution, Enrollment Trends, Monthly Attendance Trends, Fee Collection Status, Subject Performance Comparison, and Community Demographics.
